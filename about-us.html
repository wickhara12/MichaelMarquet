			<h2>About Michael Marquet</h2>
			<p>
				Michael Marquet was born in Christchurch in 1964 and during his first five years,
				he developed a huge speech problem that puzzled many doctors, psycholgists and even his own family.
				From 1977-1980 Michael was one of youngest competitors in marathon running. 
				In 1977, at the age of 12, Micheal ran the fastest time of 3.30:11 and set a New Zealand record for his age.
				By the time he left high school (Aranui High School) at the age of fifteen, Michael's reading age was
				about that of a six-year-old, his IQ was about 70 and he had trouble writting his own name.
			</p>
			<p>
				From 1967-1985 Michael underwent speech therapy until he was 21 years of age. Afterwards Michael had many tutors
				that helped him to learn how to read and write. This allowed him in 1987-88 to write in his first book.
				(Michael's Challenge: overcoming illiteracy)  <br>
				Michael currently lives in Christchurch, New Zealand with his wife Shona and his daughter Mikayla.          
			</p>
	 
			<h2>Literature</h2>
			<p> 
				Michael began writting his first book (Michael's Challenge: overcoming illiteracy) in 1987,
				with the help of his writing tutor.
				After launching this book, he was nominated on behalf of the New Zealand Federation, for a UNESCO 
				(United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organisation) Literacy adult and learning assistance award. 
				Which in September 1988, Michael received a literacy adult and learning assistance award in Paris, France.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1991 Michael published his second book (Literacy my prize: how I learnt to read & write).
				Then in 2011, Michael published his third book (Illiteracy to millionaire: just don't give up)
				and his fourth book (Unique Antique Treasures: my addiction) in 2019.  
			</p>

			<h2>Gardening</h2>
			<p> At 15 and a half years old. Michael began working full time in the Chirstchurch Botanic gardens 
				as a gardener. 
				However, Michaels' dream was to work in horticulture. In 1980, Michael
				knew that he needed a trade qualification to continue his dream.
				Michael applied for an apprenticeship in 1981 but was turn down. However, in 1984, having been rejected 3 times, 
				Michael received a Christmas gift, a horticulture apprenticeship from the Director of Parks and Recreation.  
			</p>
			<p>
				From 1985-1988, Michael completed his apprenticeship (New Zealand trade Cerificate in Horticulture and Gardening).
				In 1988 Michael also then received a year's horticulture scholarship in the public gardens in Melbourne, Australia.
				<br>
				Currently, Michael is still working as a professional gardener.
